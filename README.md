# Real-Time-Interactive-Monitoring-System
Building a live system observability dashboard powered by Splunk Enterprise. The solution integrates endpoint telemetry via the Splunk Universal Forwarder to ingest granular security events generated by Sysmon, enabling instant analysis of system activities for threat hunting and operational intelligence."

Prerequisites & Installation
This section details the necessary software and the step-by-step process required to set up the Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard using Splunk, Sysmon, and the Universal Forwarder.

System Requirements
The project relies on a two-tier setup: a monitored Endpoint and a Central Server.

Endpoint Operating System: A Windows machine (like Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, or newer) that you wish to monitor. You'll need administrative privileges on this host.

Central Splunk Server: A machine (Linux or Windows) running Splunk Enterprise (or Splunk Free). Ensure it has sufficient RAM and disk space for log indexing.

Network: TCP Port 9997 must be open from the Endpoint to the Central Server to allow data transmission.

Component Installation and Configuration
1. Central Splunk Server Setup
Install Splunk Enterprise: Download and install Splunk on your central server.

Enable Receiver Port: Configure Splunk to receive data from all forwarders. Navigate to Settings → Data → Forwarding and Receiving. Add a new receiver on Port 9997 and save the configuration.

Create Index: Create a dedicated index for the security data. Go to Settings → Data → Indexes, click New Index, and name it sysmon_index. This keeps your security logs separate and organized.

Install Splunk Add-on (Recommended): Install the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Sysmon on the Search Head. This add-on provides pre-built field extractions crucial for analyzing the Sysmon data.

2. Endpoint Configuration (Sysmon & Universal Forwarder)
Install Sysmon:

Download the Sysmon utility from Sysinternals.

Acquire a robust configuration file (e.g., a custom or community-vetted config.xml that filters out noisy events).

Install Sysmon from an elevated command prompt using your configuration file:
Sysmon.exe -i <path-to-config.xml> -accepteula

Install Splunk Universal Forwarder (UF):

Download and install the UF on the monitored endpoint.

During installation, you must point the UF to your Central Server by specifying the Indexer Hostname/IP and the Receiving Port (9997).

Configure UF Inputs:

Edit the inputs.conf file (located in the UF's configuration directory) to instruct it to read the Sysmon event log.

Add the following stanza to the file:

[WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
disabled = false
index = sysmon_index
sourcetype = XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
renderXml = 1
The renderXml = 1 setting ensures the detailed event data is forwarded, which is necessary for the add-on to extract all fields correctly.

Restart Service: Apply all changes by restarting the Universal Forwarder service:
net stop SplunkForwarder
net start SplunkForwarder


Data Validation
To confirm successful setup, run a basic search on your Central Splunk Server:

index=sysmon_index | timechart count by host limit=1


Search & Analysis

Validate Sysmon Data Flow: Confirm the data is being parsed correctly on the Splunk Search Head.

Search: index=sysmon_index | head 10

Goal: Ensure the Sysmon Event Codes (e.g., EventCode=1 for Process Creation, EventCode=3 for Network Connection) and critical fields (like Image, CommandLine, DestinationIp) are being automatically extracted.

Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Based on a security monitoring goal, identify the critical questions your dashboard needs to answer. These translate directly into your dashboard panels.


What new processes are running?	EventCode=1 (Process Create)	Top 10 New Processes
Is a process connecting externally?	EventCode=3 (Network Connect)	Top Destination IPs by Process
Are any files being created/modified in suspicious locations?	EventCode=11 (File Create)	Top File Modifications by Path


Dashboard Panels & Search Queries (SPL)

Dashboard Overview & Design
Dashboard Name: Endpoint Activity Monitor

Purpose: Provide real-time visibility into the security posture of the monitored endpoint(s). Designed for Tier 1 Security Analysts.

Panel 1: Top 10 Executed Processes
Goal: Identify the most frequently executed programs over the last 24 hours to spot anomalies or newly introduced executables.

Visualization: Bar Chart
index=sysmon_index EventCode=1 
| stats count by Image 
| sort - count 
| head 10

Panel 2: Network Connection Summary
Goal: Show a summary of internal vs. external network connections.

Visualization: Pie Chart
index=sysmon_index EventCode=3 
| eval Connection_Type=if(match(DestinationIp, "192\.168\.|10\.|172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])"), "Internal", "External")
| stats count by Connection_Type

Panel 3: PowerShell Activity Over Time
Goal: Track the volume of PowerShell execution, a common indicator of attack (IOA).

Visualization: Time Chart
index=sysmon_index EventCode=1 Image="*powershell.exe" 
| timechart count as "PowerShell Executions"

Similarily U can make more panels according to your needs 

AT LAST YOU WILL HAVE YOUR DESIRED LIVE DASHBOARD THEN U CAN OPTIMIZE IT ACCORDING TO YOUR NEED AND PURPOSE .
